The Shell Implementation System project aims to develop a lightweight command-line shell that allows users to interact with the operating system through a user-friendly interface. This shell supports essential functionalities, including executing built-in commands such as cd, help, and exit, as well as running external programs. Users can navigate the file system, obtain help information, and terminate the shell session seamlessly. The project incorporates process management features, utilizing system calls like fork, exec, and waitpid to manage child processes effectively. Additionally, it enables dynamic memory management to handle user inputs and command tokens efficiently. By creating a robust environment for executing commands, this project provides a foundational understanding of operating system principles and enhances user interaction with the underlying system. The implementation will serve as a valuable educational tool, illustrating key concepts in system programming and command-line interface design.
